Blameless post-mortems
 ? Honesty with customers

 
elements:

* summary of what happeded and what was the impact
* how was the incident resolved
* a complete timeline of what happened
* causes (plural!)
* what went well and what went poorly during handling of the incident
* follow-up actions
  ? How do I keep this going out of bounds?

Get some practice:

* simulate an incident (@badthingsdaily)
* cause an incident (Chaos Monkey)
* Lower the threshold for what is an incident

hot wash or post-action review (military)
post-morbidity and mortality conference (doctors)
(NTSB)
