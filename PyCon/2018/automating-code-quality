SDK for Python AWS (different from boto3)
chalice, a Python-based microservices client

his big 3:
* flake8: a wrapper for 3 tools
  - pycodestyle (pep8, style)
  - pyflakes (probable errors - unused imports & variables)
  - mccabe (complexity checker - mccabe suggests a max complexity of 10)
* pylint: more opinionated than flake8, and slower (so run 2nd)
* coverage

some more:
* mypy static code analysis tool
* pydocstyle 
* doc8

local automation:
* requirements-dev.txt separate from requirement-doc.txt and requirements.txt
* Makefiles, duh

remote automation:
* .travis.yml

further Ideas:
* doclink checks!
