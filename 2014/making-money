cheap - don't want to pay
lazy - don't want to do
selfish - want the stuff - easier to give back to community than maintain 

Eric Raymond's new build system - failed.
don't create new project, join one.
community more important than code

"forums don't work" - it is the project's job to make sure answers are given
on forums.

release early & often - aim for each release (including alpha) to be bug-free.
work with distros & cloud providers to get product in.

"You can't create a business with Apache license"
- can't make *lots* of money and change the industry

1)projects where lots of companies need it (linux, php, perl) successful project,
but not companies

2)internal tools realesed as open source to get more devels

3)small company coding projects to sell as open source

no offices
company of equals - all equal shares
"hacking business model"
services or development?
  services make money, but don't change the world
is software for big community or a few big companies?
do you need investors? then need an exit plan.

apache license - anyone can fork, so you can't have a software company
service company : valuation = 2 x revenue
software : valuation = 10 x revenue + X * number_users

sales points:
more users
less cost
more developers (cheaper)
no trap doors
no vendor lock
trustworthy - licenses won't change, support wont' end, company won't go out 
  of business

BSD too free for business
open core - open source core, with closed features on top for sale
  he thinks this is functionally not open-source. (but it is a valid business
  model, as long as you are transparent about it)
dual license - viral GPL plus commercial 
  must own all of the code
  gpl only works well fofr infrastrucure, easily embeddible products (libs, db)
    then people will buy a license for something they want to keep closed source
  agpl works for SAS (iText, mongodb)
business source or time-delayed open source
  source code available from start, but can't be used commercially under some
  conditions. After X years, code will automatically convert to some open source
  license.
  3-5 years is reasonable. Start as GPL, convert to BSD? commercial must equal open.

  each new version restarts the clock for that version
