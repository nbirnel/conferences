Don't trust data

Abraham Wald's military plane armoring story (survivorship bias)

"Selection bias is one of the major flaws associated with increased
availability of Big Data"

Outlier removal, outlier reduction. (minsky)
You can't always remove outliers - fraud detection

Don't trust stats
==============================

the same signatures (mu/mean and sigma/deviation) can conceal very different 
data sets. Visualization helps

confounding variables
++++++++++++++++++++++
* indpependant variable: number of firemen sent to a fire
* dependant variable: cost of fire damage
* Firemen increase cost of fire. 
* confounding variable: size of fire
 
Simpson's paradox
+++++++++++++++++
Can work both ways

when your algorithm is Lying
==============================
bias and variance are tradeoffs, but you can't calculate the true correct fit,

* simple algorithms -> bias -> underfit
* complex algorithms -> variance -> overfit

since the underlying function is unknown.

got high variance? remove variable, bagging. more data doesn't help!

Your A/B tests are lying
========================
* incorrect segmentation
* premature termination
* one-tailed test.

Biased Word Embedding: the Difficult Truth
==========================================
"Machine Bias is Human Bias in disguise"
