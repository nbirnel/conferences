*keys + agents
comment at end of public key is arbitrary and can be anything
ssh-copy-id (like my authme. Dedupes!)
authorized_keys2 was made for protocol2, marked as deprecated
force command in authorized_keys:
command='/path/to/command', no-port-forwarding, ssh-rsa SDKJALAAAaasdf comment

ssh-agents carry keys - locked or unlocked. Some have timeouts.o

ssh fowarding:
ssh -A 
while you are connected, someone could use you ssh-sock.
ssh jumpbox -A
from jumpbox, ssh to wherever you are going.

*config
Host irc
  Hostname irc.domain.name     (ie, this is like an alias)
Match *lighthouse.sec
  Username root@lighthouse.sec
  ForwardAgent yes 
You can inherit in configs

Keeping alive:
TCPKeepAlive - pings every 3 seconds, possilbly allows someone to spoof
ServerAliveInterval - goes within encrypted session

mosh:
leaves keys in the proc ENV

ssh commandline: 
~ at beginning of line.
~. terminated connection
~# list forwarded connections

*port forward & tunnels
ssh -L8080:intranet.mozilla.mozilla.org:443 ssh.mozilla.com
reverse forwards:
broadcast local 8000 to 2241
ssh -N R0.0.0.0:2241:localhost:8000 bke.ro
python2 -mSimpleHTTPServer
serve up a local directory as a webhost

"poor man's proxy"
dynamic forwards (SOCKS proxy)
-N no command prompt
ssh -N -D1080 ssh.mozilla.com

tsox curl icanhazip.com

sshuttle (on github) - does some fancy iptables 

*xforwarding (changed since 90s)
ssh -X server.org    (old style)
ssh -XY server.org    (just disables all the security stuff in X to speed it up)
Xpra - "like screen for X"
ssh foo.com
xpra start :10
DISPLAY=:10 xterm

from some other host, ssh in, and:
xpra list

or, xpra attach hostname

*muliplexing connections
man ssh_config ControlMaster, ControlPath
in config:
  ControlMaster
  ControlPath /home/nbirnel/.ssh/%h.socket

allows us to multiplex connections through one.
*best practices
PermitRootLogin no  - accountibility, who did this, disgruntled employees
GatewayPorts        - only allows forwarding connections to localhost
Keys only (authentication methods: publickey, or force root to use a key(then at least you know which key was used))
AuthorizedKeysCommand - added in the last few months, runs a script to see who should be able to log in
