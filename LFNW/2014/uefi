tools for manipulating UEFI boot menu entries - from windows or linux

single boot - easy: 
  UEFI-native is fine
  BIOS-native is fine (CSM - Compatibility Suport Module)
  Secure boot on or off is fine (if distro supports it)

mulit boot golden rule:
  install 2nd os same way current OS installed:
  windows 8 is UEFI-native
  Vista pre-SP1 is BIOS-native
  in between, check Disk Management for EFI System Partition
  
  Linux: check output of efibootmgr (an error means we are not in EFI),
  or see if /sys/firmware/efi

boot installer in mode we wish to use
don't 'trick' UEFI into a different mode

writing uefi-native meida:
dd an iso file, or optical media
(Fedora specific?)
Livecd-iso-to-disk --efi --format --rest-mbr

unetbootin probably won't work

Peter Jackson - peboot? a way to sign your own key

Matthew Garrett - pushed through Microsoft tells OEM
that Intel x86 SecureBoot *must* be user-toggleable.
but - ARM SecureBoot must *not* be able to be turned off.
(or maybe this is a hardware issue?)

there are intel tablets, though

problems - what mode am I in?
"don't use noefi"
