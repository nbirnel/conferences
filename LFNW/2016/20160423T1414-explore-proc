rm /var/log/httpd/access_log
lsof | grep access_log
# grab PID and FD(eg 7w - fd7 opened as write only)
cd /prod/$PID/fd
ls -lah
cp $FD(minues the w) /tmp/restored_log

those proc files are symlinks.

/proc/cmdline - boot args
/proc/1/cmdline - what is my init!

/proc/<pid>/oom_adj a per-process adjustable: -17 = never kill, 15 kill freely
 deprecated for oom_scale_adjust?

pidof myproc
pgrep -uroot myproc
cat /prod/self/cmdline - self is an alias 
o

/proc/sys - kernel tunables
sysctl -a 
  output can be seen in /proc/sys
many defined in /etc/sysctl.conf
so on the fly echo to /proc/sys/[tunable/path]

vmstat iostat ("when we don't have new relic or appdynamics")
  they are just reading proc

ss -nltp

a few things have been moved into /sys
