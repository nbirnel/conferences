create a deploy code checklist
might make a single deploy checklist
or a general one, customized for different types of deploy
predeploy (commit, merge, package, test, dependancies)
deploy (add dependancies, deploy, restart)
post-deploy (test (rollback), switch service, clean up, get ready for next release)
could have checklists inside checklist (he uses trello)

perl scripts - hard to maintain
git update - rollback is hard, manual
packages - must build, another service
images - may be unwieldy
docker - "not a standard yet", runs in an LXC

build servers:
atlassian bamboo
anthillpro
TC
jenkins (the most popular)
buildbot (his favorite)

highstate = ShellCommand(name = foo, command = 'salt * sate.higstate', description)
checkout = ......git checkout
BuildFactory.addStep highstate
BuildFactory.addStep checkout
BuildFactory.addStep highstate

force build through GUI
