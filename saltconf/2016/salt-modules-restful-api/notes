states: must return
{ 'name': name,
  'changes': { 
      'old': old_data
      'new': new_data
  },
  'comment': '',
  'result': True|False
}

Shoudl always have a test=True test
could also have a pchanges dictionary = set up to see what we are going to do,
  then use that for test=True and/or the actual performance

He recommends to 'figure out as much as you can about current state, and figure
out what we would do, then check if we are testing. If so, bail - otherwise, 
proceed.'. See state.pip_state for what he considers a good example.

local = salt
caller = salt-call
runner = salt-run
cloud = salt-cloud
ssh = salt-ssh
wheel = eg salt-key -a

restful API is just a wrapper
a script called salt-api which provides restful api for salt
