               Security
               Code Quality (difficult to audit a container provided by devs/3rd party)
               Container hosting 
               peer / service discovery 
               config changes (having salt inside docker container?)
               supervision (docker tries to do it, so does systemd)
               monitored (docker hostnames are random!)
               rolling deployment (canary analysis)
               networking
               kubernetes/mesos (scheduling)
docker         docker

golden images vs config management - not either/or, but a spectrum
