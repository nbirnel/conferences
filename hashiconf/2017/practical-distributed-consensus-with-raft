Johm Osterhout: Raft

leader, follower, candidate
all start as follower
not hearing from a leader, promote self to candidate. Vote for me!
Once a majority found, a leader is elected.

Now all changes to the system go to the leader,
which is responsible for maintaining state.
When leader receives a request, it tells followers to add change to log.
When it gets an OK back, it updates it's state, then tells followers to commit.
When it gets an OK back, it sends OK to the client.
