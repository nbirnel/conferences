tcpdump -G to a big disk, and rotate periodically, clean up after 2 days.
Then you can go back and wireshark it if you need.

monitoring: different than logging. 

checking for the unknown:
RUM (real user monitoring - boomer.)

alert: 
* page - broken. Fix it now.
* ticket - weird, or requiring investigation.
* log - "don't look at your logs. Look at them when you know you have trouble,
  or are trying to improve"
* no email
alert based on:
* known bad
* percentages
* trend (on Saturday, how did I look last Saturday - not how did I look yesterday)
* rapid changes

SLA - a measure of risk-taking potential. ( i have 40 minutes of available down
time before EOQ. Push without testing.)
