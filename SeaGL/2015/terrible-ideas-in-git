git config --global help.autocorrect [10ths of a second to wait]

github/nvbn/thefuck (super duper autocorrect)

acaudwell/Gource - a 'useless' display of git history

https://myrepos.branchable.com - a cache of repos we have.( ie, you can fetch all repos you have

He also has git annex

powerline - prompt for git status
git supershell - zsh only
